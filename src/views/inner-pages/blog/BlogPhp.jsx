                                                These are very powerful open source technologies that allow
                                                a programmer and web developer to design functional sites and
                                                applications. They are tools used to develop web applications.
                                                The app or website goes beyond the basic HTML. PHP is particularly
                                                designed to generate interactive and modern websites. On the
                                                other hand, MySQL is a leading data.

                                                You will definitely learn some new things.

                                                A definition will be ideal to help you understand what a PHP
                                                and Mysql web development is all about.

                                                These tools produce better results when they are used together.
                                                So as you keep reading, you will understand how PHP and
                                                MySQL work together to produce an interactive and effective web
                                                application. If you want to design web applications in no time,
                                                then you have to use these technologies.

                                                The PHP language is written in C. This programming language is
                                                powered by a company known as the Zend Engine. PHP was initially
                                                developed by Rasmus Lerdorf in1995. Two years later, the language
                                                was rewritten by Zeev Suraski and Audi Gutmans. After the release
                                                of the 5.3 version in 2009, the programming language gained so
                                                much popularity because of its flexibility.
